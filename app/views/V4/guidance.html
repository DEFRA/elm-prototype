        <h2 id="how-much" class="govuk-heading-l">How much will be paid</h2>
        <p>£88 per hectare (ha).</p>


        <!-- <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Where to use this option</h2>

        <p>Available for Mid Tier and Higher Tier</p>

        <p>In Mid Tier this option can only be used subject to eligibility checks. The land must be mapped as Upland breeding bird areas for Countryside Stewardship, see MAGIC.</p>

        <p>Whole or part parcel</p>

        <p>Only on permanent grassland parcels of at least 2ha that are within a Less Favoured Area. This includes allotments, intakes, newtakes and semi-improved in-bye that already support (or have the potential to support) breeding waders.</p>

        <p>The applicant must also meet at least one of the following conditions to use this option:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>follow a recommended fertiliser management system to plan nutrient inputs across the farm</li>
              <li>adopt a recommended fertiliser management system within 18 months of the start of the agreement</li>
              <li>qualify as a low intensity farmer</li>
            </ul> -->



        <h2 id="features" class="govuk-heading-l">Features that can be included in this option</h2>

        <p>The following features can be included if they are part of the land, even if they are ineligible for the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS):</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>ditches, dykes, drains, rivers, streams that are less than 4m wide for the majority of their length in the parcel</li>
              <li>temporary water</li>
              <li>natural unsurfaced roads, tracks, paths and bridleways, as long as the requirements can still be met</li>
              <li>bracken</li>
              <li>areas of scree, rock outcrops and boulders – each area can cover up to 0.1ha</li>
              <li>permanent water up to 0.1ha</li>
              <li>grazed woodland and scrub that allows livestock access and has grass underneath</li>
            </ul>



        <h2 id="environment" class="govuk-heading-l">How this option will benefit the environment</h2>

        <p>It is for restoring or maintaining upland bird populations. The option brings about water level management and provides the appropriate grassland habitat and sward structure for feeding and nesting.</p>

        <p>If successful there will be rough grassland habitat supporting target species. Where appropriate, a water level management regime may also be in place, including scrapes and foot-drains. The water level management will also have enhanced pools or ditches for aquatic plants, invertebrates and other important species.</p>



        <h2 id="requirements" class="govuk-heading-l">Requirements</h2>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>manage the sward by grazing and/or cutting to maintain a varied sward to benefit upland waders by achieving a sward height of less than 5cm over 50% of the parcel area by 15 March</li>
              <li>only graze in line with an agreed stocking calendar, which includes minimum and maximum stocking rates by grazing animal type by month</li>
              <li>manage scrub to achieve cover of between 1% and 5% of the parcel</li>
              <li>manage bracken and make sure bracken litter doesn’t cover more than 25% cover across any area of bracken</li>
              <li>manage dense rush so that stands of soft or hard rush don’t cover more than 20% of the parcel and the rush height is less than 20cm by 30 September</li>
              <li>manage field operations to reduce effects on breeding birds</li>
              <li>manage wet features to provide muddy areas for waders to feed</li>
            </ul>

        <p>Do not:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>supplementary feed except for the provision of mineral blocks (non-energy based)</li>
            </ul>




        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Keeping records</h3>

        <p>Agreement holders will need to keep the following records and supply them on request:</p>

            photographs of the extent of bracken on the option area before works start
            a map of the land drainage system
            a stocking calendar
            evidence that a recommended fertiliser management system is used or evidence to support low intensity farmer claim
            field operations at the parcel level, including associated invoices
            stock records to show grazing activity on parcels
            a count of breeding birds in year 5 of the agreement

        <p>On your annual claim you will be asked to declare that you haven’t carried out any activities prohibited by the option requirements.</p>

        <p>You should also be aware that at the start of each claim year, a percentage of agreement holders will be asked to take and submit the following photographic records:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>photographs of the management undertaken</li>
            </ul>

        <p>Applicants will have to send the following with their application:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>a map of the extent of bracken on the option area - this can be marked on any map including the Farm Environment Record (FER)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 id="advice" class="govuk-heading-l">Advice and suggestions for how to carry out this option</h2>

        <h3 id="location" class="govuk-heading-m">Pick the right location</h3>
        <p>Choose sites that:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>are open, with any surrounding hedges less than about 2m high</li>
              <li>experience minimal disturbance (from footpaths or public rights of way)</li>
              <li>have no overhead pylons or power lines</li>
              <li>have no in-field trees</li>
              <li>are not next to woodland</li>
              <li>have either an existing high water table or surface water attributes (flushes, ditches, foot drains), or where they could be created</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 id="sites" class="govuk-heading-m">Sites to avoid</h3>
        <p>Avoid sites that are:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>steep (above 14:1, or 8 degrees)</li>
              <li>less than 2ha and bounded by tall (over 2m) hedgerows, scrub or trees</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 id="vegetation" class="govuk-heading-m">Vegetation management</h3>
        <p>Tailor vegetation management to the target species - usually a range of vegetation heights is preferred.</p>

        <h3 id="wet" class="govuk-heading-m">Management of wet features (drains, grips, scrapes)</h3>
        <p>Provide surface wet features from 1 March to 1 June (such as scrapes, flushes, foot drains or surface standing water). At least 50% of the wet features’ edges should have exposed mud at the water’s edge to promote invertebrate activity and allow chicks access to feed.</p>
        <p>Consider the need to re-profile man-made wet features annually and maintain as required.</p>
        <p>Any mechanical operations should be scheduled for the driest period of the year (or after mid-August if breeding snipe are present).</p>
        <p>Manage soft and hard rushes so that they cover no more than 20% of the option land.</p>

        <h3 id="grazing" class="govuk-heading-m">Grazing</h3>
        <p>Use quiet stock on these sites to avoid unnecessary trampling of nests and chicks.</p>
        <p>Adequate grazing and appropriate mechanical operations after the breeding season (August to March) are vital to create the desired vegetation mosaic for the following spring.</p>
        <p>It is important that there is adequate grazing available which is not in breeding bird options to retain flexibility to manage the breeding bird areas correctly during the breeding season.</p>
