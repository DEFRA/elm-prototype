      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"><a name="why"></a>Why create plots for ground nesting birds?</h2>
        <p>Successfully established and well managed plots are a valuable and reliable source of winter food for a range of seed eating farmland bird species. Plots also provide:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>shelter for birds, insects and mammals throughout the year</li>

        </ul>
    

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"><a name="where">Where to sow</a></h2>
      <p>To be successful, you need to choose a good location for your plots. You can move plots around the farm to fit your cropping. The best locations are:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>sunny and south or south-west facing</li>
        <li>fertile</li>
        <li>weed free</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Put your plots near to other foraging and roosting habitats to reduce the distance birds have to travel. Suitable foraging and roosting habitats include unharvested cereal strips, overwinter stubbles, hedgerows, fallow areas, ponds and ditches.</p>
      <p>You should avoid sites:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>with a high weed burden which will affect your establishment success</li>
        <li>that are shady and north facing – this can lead to poor establishment and low seed production</li>
        <li>which are difficult to access and manage, such as remote field corners</li>
        <li>next to public highways or public rights of way – regular disturbance stops birds from feeding</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"><a name="spring">Spring-sown winter bird food plots</a></h2>
      <p>At least half of the total area in hectares of winter bird food plots on your land should be spring-sown.</p>
      <p>You can sow plots in either spring or autumn. You should use spring sown plots where possible. Spring-sown plots are better because they provide seeds every winter. You can consider autumn-sown plots if spring-sown crops are difficult to establish on your land. For example, if you have:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>regular spring droughts and often higher soil moisture in late summer</li>
        <li>heavy soil and cannot create a good seedbed until late spring</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Where and how you sow plots is the same in spring and autumn. You will need to change when and what you sow for autumn-sown plots.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What to sow in spring-sown plots</h3>
      <p>Annual and biannual seed mixes can be created from crops like spring wheat, spring oats, spring triticale, red millet, white millet, linseed, gold of pleasure, quinoa, mustard, kale and fodder radish</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Creating your own spring-sown seed mix</h3>
      <p>You can create your own seed mix to suit your local conditions and soil type. Different bird species feed on different types of seed. Your plot should provide different types of seed to feed a range of farmland birds.</p>
      <p>You can add flower species to your seed mix to provide an extra source of pollen and nectar during the growing season, and structural crops to provide cover and support to weaker stemmed crops. Keep the seed rate of flowers and structural crops low to stop them outcompeting your seed producing crops.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Target a species with a spring-sown seed mix</h3>
      <p>You can use a seed mix which meets the specific needs of an individual species, like cirl bunting, corn bunting, grey partridge and tree sparrow. You can use a relevant seed mix if you know a species is present in your area.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">When to sow spring-sown plots</h3>
      <p>For the best yields sow when the weather and soil moisture is best for the crops in your mix. In spring sow:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>cereals in March or April – to give plants enough time to flower and set seed before winter</li>
        <li>buckwheat, dwarf sunflower, red millet and white millet from May to the end of June – when soil and air temperatures are higher and there is available soil moisture</li>
        <li>linseed, quinoa and brassica crops from May to the end of June – you can sow from March but frost will affect the yield</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How to sow</h3>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Create your seedbed</h3>
      <p>Aim for a well consolidated, firm, fine, level and weed free seedbed to ensure good crop establishment. Creating stale seedbeds before sowing is the most effective way to control weeds.</p>
      <p>On lighter soils, be careful not to create ‘fluffy’ overworked seedbeds. This results in poor emergence due to seed being sown too deep and ‘capping’ following rain.</p>
      <p>Use a ring roll on heavier soils where seedbeds are very uneven after secondary cultivations. Cloddy and uneven seedbeds cause uneven establishment. Seed is sown at different depths, there is poorer seed to soil contact and a higher risk of slug damage.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How to distribute the crops in your plots</h3>
      <p>You can decide where to sow the crops in your seed mix within the plot. You can either sow:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>all the crops together in the plot as an unharvestable mix</li>
        <li>individual crops next to each other in strips or blocks</li>
        <li>crop groups next to each other in strips or blocks, for example sow cereals and brassicas separately</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Sowing</h3>
      <p>Mix the seed in the hopper immediately before sowing an unharvestable mix to prevent an uneven spread of crops in your plot. Larger seeds settle at the top and smaller seeds at the bottom of the hopper during transit and drilling.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Sowing technique</h3>
      <p>Sowing technique is your choice depending on your land, equipment and experience. You can drill or broadcast your seed mix and you can sow in one pass or two passes.</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>is the quickest and most cost effective sowing technique</li>
        <li>can be very effective with an ideal seedbed and weather</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sowing in one pass can cause poorer germination and lower yields. You cannot sow all crops in a mix at the best depth or time of year.</p>
      <p>Sowing your seed mix in two passes allows you to sow all crops at the best depth and time of year:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>From April to the end of May drill larger seeds such as cereals and dwarf sunflowers</li>
        <li>From May to mid-June drill or broadcast smaller seeds</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The benefit of sowing in two passes is better germination success and yield. Your machinery and labour costs are higher when sowing in two passes.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Sowing depth</h3>
      <p>Sow larger cereal seeds 2.5cm deep. Sow smaller seeded crops 1cm deep.</p>
      <p>Sow at 1cm deep when sowing in one pass, so that smaller seeds are not sown too deep. </p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Drill row width</h3>
      <p>Sow crops on a 4-5 inch row spacing. When sowing in two passes, you can sow cereals on a 10-15 inch row spacing. A wider row spacing lets crops sown later grow bigger and produce more seed.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Rolling</h3>
      <p>Roll after drilling or broadcasting to help keep moisture, ensure good seed soil contact and reduce slug damage. Do not roll where there is a risk of ‘capping’.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"><a name="considerations"></a>Considerations for successful management</h2>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Crop nutrition</h3>
      <p>It is important that you apply fertiliser so the crops in your plots produce enough seed. Test the soil in your plots so you know what fertiliser and how much to apply. Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) fertiliser is important, particularly where plots are grown on light soils or in the same place for several years. Typical annual application rates of N are about 50-60 kg/ha. Apply similar amounts of P and K if needed. You can consider using manganese, lime and other nutritional products to correct pH and other deficiencies as needed.</p>
      <p>All fertiliser recommendations must be provided by a Fertiliser Advisers Certification and Training Scheme (FACTS) qualified adviser. A FACTS adviser will take into account: soil type, soil N supply, soil test results, previous cropping and crop requirements.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Retention date</h3>
      <p>Keep plots until the beginning of March, so that seeds and cover are available for farmland birds throughout the winter.</p>
      <p>Plots can be destroyed from the start of February on heavier soils that need a longer cultivation window to create a workable seedbed. Use supplementary feeding after you destroy your plots until spring to continue providing a source of food for farmland birds.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Weed control</h3>
      <p>You do not need to keep plots completely weed free. Weed seeds are a valuable food source for farmland birds, in particular black bindweed, chickweed, fat hen and knotgrass. Consider weed control where there is a high weed burden that will cause poor crop establishment or lower seed production.</p>
      <p>Always consult with a British Agrochemical Standards Inspection Scheme (BASIS) qualified agronomist when using herbicides. A BASIS agronomist will make sure you use the most appropriate product and that dose rates are safe to all crops and effective on target weeds. Only use herbicides approved for use on land temporarily taken out of production or game cover.</p>
