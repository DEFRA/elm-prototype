      <!-- MAIN CONTENTS -->  
      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"><a name="where"></a>Where can you find historic features?</h2>
        <p>You can find historic features in grassland all over England. Even where arable cropping is the main land use, you can find small areas of grass containing historic features.</p>
        <p>There are several ways you can find out whether you have any historic features:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Historic England keep a list of legally protected scheduled monuments</li>
          <li>local authorities may keep a historic environment record which will tell you about the known historic features in your area</li>
          <li>various features such as earthworks, tumuli and ‘antiquities’ are recorded on maps such as the early editions of the Ordnance Survey</li>
          <li>if you think you have a historic feature but cannot find it mentioned in any of these places, you could ask your local authority’s archaeologist</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>You may think there is nothing left of the historic features recorded for your land, but remains could still survive. If you look when the sun is low in the sky you may be able to see faint surface features as shadows or where frost has partly melted. In dry summer weather, underground remains which are not normally visible sometimes show up. Grass becomes stressed and parched over buried masonry, or lusher where the soil is deeper, for example over an infilled ditch. This leaves patterns that can be seen from above.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"><a name="what"></a>What are historic features?</h2>

        <p>For thousands of years humans have lived, worked, fought, travelled and worshipped in England and these activities have all left their mark on the landscape.</p>
        <p>On your land you may have:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>buildings and structures which are visible above ground</li>
            <li>earthworks such as humps, hollows, banks and ditches on the ground’s surface</li>
            <li>remains located just below the ground surface that are not visible by eye</li>
          </ul>

        <p>If managing your land with historic features in mind is new to you, it may be useful to ask for professional advice. This will help you understand why the site is important and where the most vulnerable features are.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"><a name="why"></a>Why looking after historic features is important</h2>
      <p>Looking after the historic features in your grassland can help to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>preserve them for future generations to learn from and enjoy</li>
        <li>once they are lost historic features cannot be recreated</li>
        <li>teach us more about what lies under our feet, enabling us to better understand our history</li>
        <li>contribute to the landscape of an area</li>
        <li>provide protection for wild plants, insects, reptiles and birds</li>
      </ul>

        <p>Some historic features are protected by law, and following this guidance will help you manage them in a way which complies with the law.</p>

        <p>When historic features are found within flower rich habitats or alongside sensitive wildlife, you may need to seek advice on balancing the needs of the wildlife with those of the historical features. It is often possible for both to be met.</p>
        
      
        
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"><a name="how">How do you know when you are successful?</a></h2>

        <p>You will know the management is right when you see:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>grass is short enough that you can see the shape of any earthworks</li>
          <li>if earthworks are in a group, an idea of how they would have looked together originally</li>
          <li>sufficient grazing animals are able to maintain the sward without allowing bare patches to appear or scrub to become established</li>
          <li>few or no signs of burrowing animals digging into the feature</li>
          <li>no vehicles have been on or close to the historic features, leaving tracks or ruts</li>
        </ul>

        <br/>
        <p>You will need to change your management if you see:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>bare patches and erosion</li>
          <li>modern structures interrupting the view of a group of historic features</li>
          <li>scrub obscuring historic features, or an increase in existing areas of scrub </li>
          <li>animals are actively burrowing on the feature</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"><a name="considerations">Considerations for successful management</a></h2>
        <h4 class="govuk-heading-m">Suitable cover</h4>
        <p>A complete covering of grass is the best protection for historic features. Other shallow rooting flowering plants are also suitable. Grazing or cutting can be used to maintain the sward, but it may be difficult to cut without damaging earthworks.</p>

        <h4 class="govuk-heading-m">Grazing</h4>
        <p>Your judgement will be crucial to make sure livestock types and numbers are right at different times of the year. The right animals to graze your historic site will depend on the site and your circumstances. If you cannot get the ideal animals, careful stock management and awareness of the potential problems can help you avoid harming the historic features.</p>

        <h4 class="govuk-heading-m">Avoiding surface erosion</h4>
        <p>Historic features will be worn away faster if there are bare patches in the grass. This can change the shape of the feature so that it is more difficult to see what it once was. The main cause of bare patches is overgrazing. This may be from having too many animals on your land, or leaving them on it for too long or at the wrong time of year. Grazing with smaller animals will be helpful, especially on steep slopes or wetter soils. </p>
        <p>Bare patches may develop due to the way livestock move around your field. They may be funnelled through gateways or between patches of scrub or trees or have favourite routes to water, feed or shade. The solution could be to move watering and feeding places or create alternative routes. You could move livestock out of the field at certain times of year or during very hot or wet weather.</p>
        <p>If the public access your land they can cause similar problems, especially if they are coming to see the historic feature. If your site gets lots of visitors, you could sow a tough variety of grass in places where they walk most. If you have interpretation boards, place them carefully to encourage visitors to stay on less sensitive parts of the site</p>
        <p>Driving on your historic feature can cause problems. Even if there is no bare ground created, the soil can be compacted which can damage underground remains or alter the shape of the feature. Make sure contractors, workers and visitors know where they can drive without damaging the historic features.</p>
        
        <h4 class="govuk-heading-m">Ground disturbance</h4>
        <p>Digging or tunnelling animals can move underground remains, making it more difficult for archaeologists to understand them at a later date. It can also change the appearance of surface features by creating subsidence and spoil heaps. The most common animals to cause problems by burrowing on historic features are badgers and rabbits. Rabbits can be controlled under the Pests Act. Badger control requires a licence from Natural England who will also provide useful advice on deterrent measures.</p>
        <p>Controlling scrub on and near to historic features will deter burrowing animals by removing cover. Consideration of which crops to plant adjacent to features can also reduce the likelihood of attracting burrowing animals, for example, badgers are attracted to maize for food.</p>
        <p>Landowners, contractors and utility company workers all carry out works which could damage features by disturbing the ground. This can be avoided by:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>producing a map which you can provide to contractors or utility workers</li>
          <li>re-using old post holes when replacing fencing</li>
          <li>avoid running any new drainage close to the historic feature</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is against the law to carry out metal detecting on some sites including scheduled monuments and military crash sites. Many metal detector enthusiasts carry out their hobby responsibly, but others do not. Problems that can be caused by irresponsible metal detecting include:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>finds not reported to the landowner or the authorities, this may be illegal depending on what has been found</li>
          <li>disturbance of other archaeological evidence while digging up finds</li>
          <li>removal of objects making it more difficult to understand the site’s history</li>
          <li>harm caused to habitats, wildlife or livestock</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Portable Antiquities Scheme website has useful information on the responsible use of metal detectors, including <a href="">guidance for landowners</a>.</p>

        <h4 class="govuk-heading-m">Reseeding</h4>
        <p>You may want to reseed an improved grass sward or introduce wildflowers to improve biodiversity. To protect the historic features, use green hay, direct drilling or seed-slotting. Chain harrowing will not damage historic features, but disc and power harrowing or rolling will.</p>

        <h4 class="govuk-heading-m">Manure and fertiliser</h4>
        <p>Applying manure or fertiliser as part of routine farming practice will not normally harm historic features, unless damage is caused by the machinery you use. A vigorously growing sward can actively discourage some <a href="">undesirable plants</a>.</p>
        <p>Ensure manure heaps are kept well away from historic features, as these can create bare patches. Runoff from stored manure can chemically damage buried archaeology.</p>

        <h4 class="govuk-heading-m">Supplementary feeding</h4>
        <p>Keep supplementary feeding of livestock away from historic features as this can cause poaching, erosion and encourage weeds.</p>

        <h4 class="govuk-heading-m">Managing undesirable plants</h4>
        <p>Plants with deep roots can damage underground archaeology. These include:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>bracken</li>
          <li>nettles</li>
          <li>Japanese Knotweed</li>
          <li>scrub and trees, especially if they fall over</li>
          <li>on grasslands, dwarf shrubs such as heather should be considered scrub</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If grazing levels are too low it can make problems from deep-rooting plants worse by allowing them to spread. It may be difficult to get grazing levels right if your animals prefer certain plants or parts of the field. You may find some places are overgrazed and develop bare patches while others are undergrazed and scrub grows. Using different animals or grazing at different times of year may help.</p>
        <p>Prevent the establishment of stands of plants whose above ground vegetation completely dies off in winter. On historic features this creates bare ground that can allow erosion to set in.</p>
        <p>Advice on controlling unwanted plants is widely available, but remember these principles when following it:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>controlling unwanted plants with hand tools and chemicals is less harmful for historic features than mechanical cutting or crushing</li>
          <li>if you use chemicals it is best to do this on foot or use light machinery, to avoid compaction and ground disturbance</li>
          <li>avoid uprooting or digging out plants this is very damaging to below ground features</li>
          <li>re-establish grass as quickly as possible when the unwanted vegetation has been removed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can find more advice in this guidance note: <a href="">BHE004 Managing scrub on historic sites</a>.</p>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"><a name="legal"></a>Legal requirements</h2>
        <p>You may find it useful to contact <a href="">Historic England</a> regarding the following:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>understanding if a historic site is protected by law</li>
          <li>advising whether you need and how to get a consent before undertaking works such as fencing, removing trees or new drainage works</li>
          <li>dealing with problems caused by other people </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you wish to manage historic features in grassland that is also a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) you will need to contact <a href="">Natural England</a> for advice on whether a consent is needed for any works you wish to undertake.</p>
