        <p>Cover crops are commonly grown to protect or improve soils. They are also known as ‘non-cash’ crops. They can be used to:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>suppress weeds</li>
          <li>prevent soil erosion and sediment leaching</li>
          <li>build and maintain soil fertility</li>
          <li>control pests and diseases</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Types of cover crops include hairy vetch, cereal rye and red clover. The type of cover crop you use will depend on your land and soil type. </p>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Benefits of doing this action</h2>

        <p>Cover crops help to reduce water and air pollution by improving:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>soil quality</li>
          <li>soil stability</li>
          <li>carbon storage</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Planting cover crops can also work to <a href="">increase organic matter in soils to reduce wind erosion</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How to plan and manage cover crops</h2>

        <!-- <p></p> -->

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How to choose the right location</h3>

        <p>This option should be used on vulnerable soil types, particularly light sandy soils within nitrate vulnerable areas.</p>
        <p>Use the run-off and soil erosion risk assessment form to identify fields at moderate or higher risk of surface run-off or soil erosion. You don’t have to use this form. You can use your own document if it gives enough information to meet the requirements.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How to choose the right cover crop</h3>

        <p>You can use either a mix or a single crop. Your choice will depend on other crops grown in the rotation, and the time of year you are planting.</p>

        <p>A mixture of seeds, such as rye, vetch, phacelia, barley or mustard, can be sown, or other crops such as ryegrass or tillage radish, but the choice of cover crop will depend on herbicide selected and the rates of application for the previous crop.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How to manage your cover crop</h3>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>remove any areas of soil compaction but do not subsoil on archaeological features</li>
          <li>establish by drilling or broadcasting</li>
          <li>sow at a suitable seed rate to provide a dense cover and protect from soil erosion</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What to do if you are planting next to a watercourse</h3>

        <p>On fields next to a watercourse that are at risk of soil erosion and runoff, you should also consider creating grass buffer strips. They will help to capture any sediment or organic materials carried in runoff water.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Where you cannot use this action</h2>

        <p>You cannot use this action on land already getting funding for <a href="">Ecological Focus Areas (EFAs)</a> declared for the <a href="">Basic Payment Scheme (BPS)</a>.</p>
