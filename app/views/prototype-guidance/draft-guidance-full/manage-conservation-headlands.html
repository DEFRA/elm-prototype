      <!-- MAIN CONTENTS -->  
      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"><a name="why"></a>Why create unharvested cereal headlands?</h2>
        <p>Sowing a cereal crop at a lower seed rate, and leaving it unharvested allows arable plants and insects to flourish within the crop. By maintaining cereal headlands you will be providing:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>an extended source of food for <a href="">farmland birds</a> and their chicks</li>
          <li>supplying feeding opportunities for pollinating insects such as bees, flies and moths</li>
          <li>space for declining arable plants to thrive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unharvested headlands are an easy way of providing added wildlife value to your holding, as their management can fit in with your cropping rotation.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"><a name="where"></a>Where to sow</h2>
        <p>The strips can be created in all soil types. Lighter soils with lower weed burden work well. Weeds will dominate less competitive arable plants, making it hard for them to thrive. For best results consider:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>open sunny locations – this will give plants a better chance of growing amongst the cereal</li>
            <li>near to cover such as hedgerows or scrub as this will provide the best feeding spots, cover for most birds and nest sites for bumblebees</li>
            <li>field edges – the best seed bank of rare arable plants is likely to be found in such locations</li>
            <li>areas with low fertiliser history –these are likely to have less of a weed burden</li>
            <li>managing for corn bunting  - mid-field locations provide safe nesting and feeding areas</li>
          </ul>
        <p>It is best if you avoid:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>shaded, cold, wet and north facing areas –most arable plants will not thrive in these conditions</li>
          <li>areas with weed problems, which often occur following non-cereal crops such as beans</li>
        </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"><a name="considerations"></a>Considerations for establishment</h2>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Plot size</h3>
      <p>The unharvested width will depend on your field size and the machinery you use. You may wish to manage a whole field or part of a field in this way. Linked headlands, rather than small isolated plots will be most useful to mobile wildlife such as bees and birds. </p>
      <p>Your unharvested areas can stay in one place. Rotating them around your farm, to fit in with your cropping system, will reduce the weed burden.</p>
      
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Crops and seed rate</h3>
      <p>Barley, wheat, triticale, rye oats and red or white millet are the best crops to sow. Maize or sorghum should not be used, as they grow tall and will shade out the plants you are encouraging to grow.</p>
      <p>You will need to create an open crop structure. This will provide the space for arable plants to grow and insects and birds to forage. The appropriate seed rate will depend on your crop choice, field conditions and sowing date. As a guide reduce your usual seed rate by 30-50%.</p>
      
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">When to sow</h3>
      <p>Spring sown crops tend to be more open in structure and give the best results. Red and white millet should be sown in the spring as it is not winter hardy. Some arable plants germinate in autumn. Unharvested areas in autumn sown crops will give a more consistent supply of food for wildlife on your farm.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"><a name="ongoing">Ongoing management</a></h2>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>avoid using any insecticides after mid-March to give insects the best chance of flourishing</li>
        <li>keep the crop until the early spring – this will provide an extended food supply for birds</li>
      </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Fertiliser and manure</h3>
        <p>You should avoid applying fertilisers or manure. Adding inputs will create a more vigorous crop. This will give less space for plants to grow.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Weed control</h3>
        <p>Thistles and docks, or large annuals like charlock can push out smaller rarer plants. Your unharvested areas will then be less attractive to wildlife. Uncontrolled weeds may increase and cause future problems. Hand removal of weeds can be effective and should be used where possible. Otherwise careful spot spraying will selectively control weeds whilst avoiding the desired plants used by wildlife.</p>
        <p>You can control black grass and bromes by using deep cultivation to bury their seeds. This method is not suitable if you have historical features in this location.  Wild oats can survive deep burying and may need treatment by a graminicide.</p>
        <p>Rotate the location of your unharvested areas to help stop weeds building up. Seek the advice of a BASIS qualified agronomist if you find them becoming troublesome. Using herbicides with only the following active ingredients should help ensure the value of your unharvested areas for wildlife are maintained.</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Amidosulfuron</li>
          <li>Clodinafop-propargyl</li>
          <li>Fenoxaprop-P-ethyl</li>
          <li>Pinoxaden</li>
          <li>Tri-allate</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For best results ensure that your unharvested plot has a minimal weed burden before sowing. You can cultivate to create a false seed bed. This encourages germination of weed seeds which you can then spray off.</p>
        <p>Think about matching the drilling date to the weed burden to help weed control. If you have problems with grass weeds then sow in the spring. Grass weeds are more widespread with autumn sowing. If you have issues with broad-leaved weeds such as redshank and annual sow thistle then sow in the autumn.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Pest control</h3>
        <p>Slugs can be a significant problem. Slug pellets can accidentally poison non-target species and contaminate surface ground waters if not applied correctly. You should only use them as a last resort. If you plan to use slug pellets:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>carry out test baiting first to confirm damaging slug population thresholds are being exceeded</li>
          <li>consider using ferric phosphate based pellets which are less toxic to other wildlife</li>
          <li>always apply metaldehyde based pellets in accordance with current Metaldehyde Stewardship best practice <a href="">https://www.getpelletwise.co.uk</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"><a name="how">How successful conservation strip should look</a></h2>
        <p>You will know when your management is right when you have:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>plenty of arable and broad leaved plants flowering and setting seed within the crop</li>
          <li>splashes of colour, with arable plants such as wild poppies growing up amongst the cereal</li>
          <li>open crop which gives birds easy access to seeds on the ground</li>
          <li>insects such as bees and butterflies feeding on nectar</li>
          <li>birds such as grey partridge and skylark foraging and eating seeds throughout the year</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"><a name="legal"></a>Legal requirements</h2>
        <p>You will need to:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>obtain consent from the <a href="">Environment Agency</a> if you wish to use herbicides near rivers and streams</li>
        </ul>
